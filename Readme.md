**LeetCode Solutions**

  This repository contains my daily solutions to algorithm and data structure problems from LeetCode. It’s a part of my continuous learning journey to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.
  
**Structure**

  **Topic**
     Solutions are organized by problem topics, such as arrays, strings, trees, etc.
  
      **Difficulty**
          Within each topic, problems are further categorized by difficulty level:
          
          **Easy** — Problems categorized as easy difficulty
